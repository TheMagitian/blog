* Introduction
This article aims to provide the *essential* steps needed to configure [[https://gnu.org/emacs][GNU Emacs]] on your own to make it a functional *IDE*. This config is inspired by [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]], a /configuration framework/ for GNU Emacs (Emacs in short).

Emacs is configured via a language called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp][Emacs Lisp]]. It allows Emacs to be customised to /extreme/ levels. The Emacs Lisp code blocks 
These blocks should be placed in the file located in *~/.emacs.d/init.el/* on Linux. Windows users may refer to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Location-of-init-file.html][GNU's manual]].

This config is *declarative*, and the Emacs Lisp packages specified in this file should install automatically after installation.

-----

* Package management

-----

** Setting the package archive

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
#+end_src

** Use-package

[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][Use-package]] is a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Macros.html][macro]] that manages package configuration. It uses the built-in /package.el/, which comes with standard GNU Emacs, as its backend.
The code snippet given below bootstraps Use-package so that it can install and manage itself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package) (package-install 'use-package)) ; install use-package with package.el
(require 'use-package-ensure)                                              ; ensure that it installs automatically
(setq use-package-always-ensure t)
(require 'use-package)                                                     ; load use-package at Emacs startup
#+end_src

-----

* Generic preferences

-----

These are generic /tweaks/ that I like better than those in *vanilla* GNU Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-splash-screen t) ; disable startup screen
(menu-bar-mode -1)             ; disable the menu bar below the application window
(tool-bar-mode -1)             ; disable the Emacs tool bar 
(scroll-bar-mode -1)           ; disable the scroll bar
(global-visual-line-mode t)    ; disable visual line mode
(auto-save-mode nil)           ; don't auto save files by default
(setq initial-buffer-choice (lambda() (get-buffer "*dashboard*"))) ; so that the Emacsclient window opens up with Dashboard each time 
(buffer-face-mode 1)           ; so that different fonts can be used on different buffers if needed
(setq auto-save-default nil)   ; set the default file location of auto-saved files to NIL
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp/"))     ; load all user-defined Emacs Lisp scripts from this directory
(let ((default-directory  "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")) (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '("*")))
(setq use-short-answers t)     ; so that yes/no questions in the minibuffer can be answered using y/n
(setq-default tab-width 4)     ; make default tab spacing 4
(delete-selection-mode 1)      ; select text and automatically overwrite without typing backspace
#+end_src

-----

* Package configuration

-----

Let's use /Use-package/ to manage packages *declaratively*. Here are a few packages I recommend:

** Evil mode

[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] is an extensible Vim emulation library for Emacs. It _faithfully_ brings almost the keybindings of the [[https://github.com/vim/vim][Vim]] text editor to Emacs, effectively transforming Emacs into a /modal editor/.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package evil
  :init (evil-mode 1) ; initialize evil mode 
  :config (evil-set-undo-system 'undo-redo)) ; set undo-redo mode to evil's 

(require 'evil-vars)
#+end_src

** Doom Modeline

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][This]] modeline is the default one used in Doom Emacs. It's /minimalistic/, and includes essential features while appearing *unique*.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Doom Modeline - https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline
[[/EmacsConfig/doom-modeline.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package doom-modeline
  :init
  (doom-modeline-mode 1)
  
  :config
  (setq doom-modeline-height 25))
#+end_src


** All the icons

[[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][This]] package provides access to a *vast* set of icons from /Github Octicons/, /FontAwesome/, etc. They can be used in Vertico, the modeline, Dired buffers, etc.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title All The Icons - in Dired
[[/EmacsConfig/all-the-icons-dired.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package all-the-icons)

(use-package all-the-icons-completion
  :after (marginalia all-the-icons)
  :hook (marginalia-mode . all-the-icons-completion-marginalia-setup)
  :init
  (all-the-icons-completion-mode))
#+end_src

** Vertico

[[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]], short for VERTical Interactive COmpletion, improves upon the default /completion/ interface in Emacs by providing a *performant* and *minimalistic* completion UI. It enhances the /minibuffer/ interface used _throughout Emacs_ for completion.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Vertico with icons
[[/EmacsConfig/vertico.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package vertico
  :init
  (vertico-mode 1)
  :config
  (setq vertico-count 17)
  (setq completion-styles '(flex))
  (setq completion-category-overrides '((file (styles . (partial-completion))))))
#+end_src

** Keybindings - General & Which-key

[[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][General]] provides a convenient, unified way to *create keybindings* in Emacs. It _integrates well_ with /Evil mode/. The =general-define-key= function allows *more flexibility* in binding keys, compared to the standard =define-key= function in GNU Emacs.

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][Which-key]] is another package for Emacs that provides a /popup/ displaying the *available keybindings* after a _particular sequence_ of keys has been typed. It's quite useful in discovering keybindings in /different modes/ and in large keymaps.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title General, along with Which-key to manage keybindings
[[/EmacsConfig/which-key.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package general
  :init
  (general-evil-setup t))

**  Flycheck

[[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][Flycheck]] is a modern /on-the-fly/ *syntax checking* package for GNU Emacs. It aims to *replace the classic Flymake*, part of GNU Emacs. It calls upon /externally installed/ *syntax* and *linting checkers* to check code as you write it.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Flycheck displaying an error in C source code
[[/EmacsConfig/flycheck.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package flycheck
  :init
  (global-flycheck-mode))
#+end_src

** Magit

[[https://magit.vc][Magit]] is an interface to the popular *Git* version control system. Implemented *entirely* in Emacs Lisp, it interacts with the command-line =git= program, and provides /functions/ and /keybindings/ to easily perform _almost all Git operations_ from within Emacs.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Using Magit to stage files
[[/EmacsConfig/magit.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package magit)
#+end_src

** Company-mode

[[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][Company mode]] is a *text completion framework* for GNU Emacs. It uses several back- and front-ends to fetch and display completion candidates, respectively. The backends include /files/, /keywords/, etc. Company mode can be _integrated_ with *LSP clients* such as /Eglot/ to provide *autocomplete* features through a /language server/.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Company mode integration with Eglot
[[/EmacsConfig/company-mode.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package company)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'global-company-mode)

(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'electric-pair-mode)
(setq company-idle-delay 0)
(setq company-minimum-prefix-length 2)
#+end_src 


** Eglot

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eglot.html][Eglot]] is a client for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol][Language Server protocol]] in Emacs. It provides a set of /commands/ that enhance the source code editing features of GNU Emacs. Since LSP is a _standard protocol_ used in various text editors, *external programs* can be invoked to provide programming *language-agnostic* features such as definition of variables, syntax errors, etc. It serves as the *backend* for autocompletion in Company-mode.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Eglot LSP functionality
[[/EmacsConfig/eglot.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package eglot
  :defer t

  :hook (c++-mode . eglot-ensure)
  :hook (go-mode . eglot-ensure))
#+end_src


** Quickrun.el

[[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/quickrun][Quickrun]] allows you to *execute code* in the /current/ buffer. It supports execution of both /interpreted/ and /compiled/ languages, and even some markup languages.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Quickrun executing C code - inline output display configured using Eros
[[/EmacsConfig/quickrun.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (marginalia-mode)
  (with-eval-after-load 'projectile
    (add-to-list 'marginalia-command-categories '(projectile-find-file . file)))
  )
#+end_src

** Org-mode

[[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] is a powerful tool built into GNU Emacs that functions like a *markup language*, helping you maintain notes, TODO lists, etc. The simple language makes it trivial to *structure* and *organize* documents. The language is *specific* to Emacs, and is used extensively in _literate programming_ and scientific research. This document is written in Org itself, and it includes markup and *code blocks*, which can be executed directly from within Emacs.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Org document - source code of this blog

** Helpful

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] is an Emacs package that *enhances* the builtin help menu in Emacs, by providing *more contextual* info, such as /function signature/, /documentation/, /keybindings/, etc.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Helpful's documentation interface

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package helpful)
#+end_src

** Rainbow delimiters

[[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][Rainbow delimiters]] provides a mode that *highlights delimiters*, such as "()" and "[]", according to their /depth/. This makes it easy to spot *matching parantheses*, brackets, etc.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Rainbow delimiters in Elisp code
[[/EmacsConfig/rainbow-delimiters.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Tree-sitter

[[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter][This]] package integrates Emacs and [[https://tree-sitter.github.io][Tree-sitter]], an /incremental parsing/ library. It provides faster and fine-grained *syntax highlighting* in Emacs, along with /syntax trees/ for source code.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Tree-sitter's effect on syntax highlighting

#+end_src

** Dashboard

[[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][Dashboard]] is an package that provides a customizable *startup screen* for GNU Emacs. It can be configured to show agenda items, bookmarks, /recently modified files/, etc.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Dashboard, with a different startup image and startup time

** Base 16 OneDark colorscheme

[[https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-emacs][This]] package includes a collection of a large number of /standard/ themes, each comprising of *16 base colours*. Since I like the [[https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro][OneDark]] colorscheme from the Atom text editor, I've set the base16-onedark colorscheme in Emacs too.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title A few themes from the base16-emacs package

#+end_src

** Diff HL

[[https://github.com/dgutov/diff-hl][Diff-HL]] is a package for GNU Emacs that provides a mode for *highlighting uncommitted changes* in version-control systems such as Git, Mercurial, etc. These are displayed in the /gutter/ region of the Emacs window.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Diff-HL showing Git status in the gutter

(add-hook 'magit-post-refresh-hook 'diff-hl-magit-post-refresh)
#+end_src 

** Consult

[[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]] is an Emacs package that provides commands to *enhance* the user's interaction with the /minibuffer/. It supports *live-previews* for currently open buffers, search within buffers, files, etc.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Consult-grep over the entire project, with live preview
[[/EmacsConfig/consult.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package consult)
#+end_src

** Orderless

[[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] provides a completion style with higher /control/ and /flexibility/ over *completion*, than that provided by default in GNU Emacs. I've configured it to make /file/ autocompletion find *partial* matches.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Orderless used in Dired file matching, alongside Vertico

#+end_src

** Eros

[[https://github.com/xiongtx/eros][Eros]], short for =E= valuation =R= esults =O= verlay =S=, displays results from *evaluating Emacs Lisp* code inside a /temporary annotation/ within the buffer. This is useful to display the *output* of code execution without having to switch to a /scratch/ buffer. The below code configures *Quickrun* to be a backend for Eros, which enables it to display the output of code executed in various languages.
